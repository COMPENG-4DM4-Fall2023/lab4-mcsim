EVERY CHANGES IN THE MEMULATOR SPEEDUP SHOULD REFLEC IN THIS DIRECTORY AS WELL. 
THIS IS THE VERSION THAT FINALLY WILL BE UPLOADED TO THE REPO FOR THE CAS PAPER.


These are the changes that may affect the behaviour (*** means that the previous code was like ****):
	1- in open commanfd gfenerator: unsigned rank = rank; // 0 *****;
	2- if(requestQueue[index]->getSize(false,0) > 0){ was removed in request scheduler FRFCFS and I added back
	3- request->addressMap[Rank] = request->rank; //***** 0; in address mapping
	4- CommandGenerator.cpp. Enabled 	std::queue<BusPacket*> empty;	std::swap(commandBuffer, empty);
	5- CommandQueue.cpp -< enabled the destructor std::vector<BusPacket*> empty;	std::swap(hrtBuffer, empty);	std::swap(srtBuffer, empty);
	6- stats in memorycontroller needs to be cleaned
	7- #include "RefreshMachine.h" is enabled in memorycontroller.h
	8- readdataarray in memorysystem: //&memoryArray[load->rank][load->bank][load->row][load->column]; and update dataarray //memoryArray[store->rank][store->bank][store->row][store->column] = &store->data; is removed	
	9- in command generator for close and open the rank reverted to what it was
	
	10 PARBS new and batching FRFCFRS double akid check

 ./Memulator -n 8 -s ../system/RTMem/RTMem.ini  -G DDR3 -D 1600K -S 4Gb_x8 -R 1 -t Mem_Trace/1M_seq.trc -c 100

Ok, so I changed the way the write in writequeu is flushed. Just note that here,m the sim is going to finish when the cua is finished servicing.\
